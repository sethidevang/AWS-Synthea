## 🔍 Project Overview

This project implements a robust AWS-powered pipeline to handle synthetic healthcare data from generation to insight. It transforms raw Synthea-generated records into structured, analysis-ready datasets using fully managed AWS services and connects with visualization tools like Power BI or QuickSight.

---

## 🧠 What is Synthea?

**Synthea** is an open-source synthetic patient generator that simulates realistic (but fictitious) health records, including:
- Demographics
- Diagnoses
- Medications
- Clinical visits
- Procedures

✅ No Personally Identifiable Information (PII)  
✅ Ideal for testing, research, and analytics

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Convert raw synthetic data to query-optimized formats
- ✅ Build a cost-efficient and automated serverless pipeline
- ✅ Enable real-time visualization and insights
- ✅ Ensure scalability with minimal maintenance

## 🛠️ Architecture & Components

| Component              | AWS Service           | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Lake**          | Amazon S3             | Store raw, intermediate, and transformed datasets                       |
| **Minor ETL**          | AWS Glue Job 1        | Clean extra commas, unnamed columns                                     |
| **Major ETL**          | AWS Glue Job 2        | Deduplication, schema standardization, CSV → Parquet                    |
| **Data Mart Creation** | AWS Glue Job 3        | Create fact/dimension tables for analytics                              |
| **Triggering**         | AWS Lambda            | Event-driven job triggering on file upload                              |
| **Workflow Automation**| AWS Glue Workflow     | Orchestrate ETL steps sequentially                                      |
| **Schema Management**  | Glue Data Catalog     | Central schema registry                                                 |
| **Query Engine**       | Amazon Athena         | Serverless SQL queries                                                  |
| **Visualization**      | Power BI / QuickSight | Interactive dashboards and business insights                            |

## ⚙️ Data Workflow

### 🔽 1. Generate Synthetic Data
- Clone Synthea from GitHub
- Modify `synthea.properties` to export CSV
- Run:
```bash
./run_synthea -p 1000
```

---

### ☁️ 2. Upload to Amazon S3
Recommended folder structure:
```
s3://bucp2final/source/
s3://bucp2final/raw/
s3://bucp2final/staging/
```

---

### 🔄 3. ETL Process

#### ➤ Minor Cleaning
- Removes unnamed columns
- Handles malformed CSVs  
_**Output:**_ `s3://bucp2final/raw/`

#### ➤ Major Cleaning & Format Conversion
- Deduplication, trimming, standardization
- Converts to Parquet  
_**Output:**_ `s3://bucp2final/staging/`

#### ➤ Data Mart Design
- Fact Table: `patient_fact`
- Dimension Tables: `encounter_dim`, `condition_dim`, `procedure_dim`, `medication_dim`, `provider_dim`, `organization_dim`, `location_dim`

---

## 📊 Reporting & Analytics

### With **Amazon QuickSight** or **Power BI**
- Direct connection to **Athena**
- Real-time querying on `bucp2_glue_db6`
- Dashboards include:
  - Demographics distribution
  - Encounter trends
  - Diagnosis breakdown
  - Medication insights

> ✅ Serverless BI  
> ✅ Scalable and shareable

---

## ✅ Conclusion

We built a production-ready AWS pipeline for synthetic healthcare data, ensuring:

- 💡 End-to-End Automation  
- ☁️ Fully Serverless Design  
- 🔎 Query-Optimized Datasets  
- 📈 Real-Time Visualizations
